## Personal LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to various LeetCode problems.

### Structure

This repository is organized into three main folders:

1. `codes`: Contains various Python solutions that I have implemented in the past.
2. `contest`: Contains all the LeetCode contests that I have participated in.
3. `notes`: Contains notes on various DSA topics, as well as my solution templates.

Within each folder, you'll find one or more Python scripts containing my solutions to the corresponding problems. The file names are structured as problem_number_problem_name.py, for example 1_two_sum.py.
