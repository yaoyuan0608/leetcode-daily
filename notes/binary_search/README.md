### Binary Search problem
Binary search is always a powerful tool when we find there is a sorted componont in the problem. Moreover, Binary search can also be applied for such problem: find the minimum/maximum values, so that all elements in the list meet the requirment. Here is a useful template to find the smallest / largest values.
